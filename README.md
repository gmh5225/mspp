# Current Features
- Async multi-threaded tcp server class (W/L)
- Sample echo tcp server (W/L)

# Compiling for Linux
Linux compilation is done on WSL:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/linux/download-install-and-setup-the-linux-development-workload?view=vs-2019#options-for-creating-a-linux-environment

After setting up WSL with g++ you can load the `mspp-linux` project and build it.
(I would recommend leaving it unloaded and load it only for builds, since it can mess up IntelliSense and ReSharper)
